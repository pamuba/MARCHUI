MongoDB offers both an Enterprise and Community version of its powerful distributed document database. The community version offers the flexible document model along with ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation to provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data. As a distributed system you get high availability through built-in replication and failover along with horizontal scalability with native sharding.

The MongoDB Enterprise Server gives you all of this and more. Review the Enterprise Server tab to learn what else is available.
